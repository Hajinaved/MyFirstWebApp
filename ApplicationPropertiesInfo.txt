So in this file i will put all the explanation of application properties with explanation
So I could refer it in future if I needed.



spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/views/

{This property spring mvc view prefix is used to set a prefix value for the default folder
where we stored the jsp files, which are views file for our project 
}




spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp

{This is the same as the upper time, but it is used for a suffix
 essentially for the mentioning the extension of a file, of a views technology we are using. 
}



spring.h2.console.enabled=true
{When we are using H2 database to store data in memory database, H2 database,
 we use this to enable the console 
 so we could write query directly to the H2 database and experimental little bit. }


spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
{This Sir is used to store a default data source url for Jdpc So the console approach the H2 database get connected to it }




spring.mvc.format.date=yyyy-MM-dd
{It is used to specify the date format, which have to be used throughout the spring mvc project }


spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
{This is very useful because when we have to initialise a database with the entities, but we are using the data as well, or schema dot sql file, to enter the rows into the table.
 So we use this to alter the flow, general flow of the table creation. So the table creation happens before the execution of schema sql }


spring.jpa.show-sql=true
{Sql query, which are being executed in the background of the programme }
